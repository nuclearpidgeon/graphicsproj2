###Type of Application
The application will be a native Windows 8 application designed to run on the Windows Slate tablets. It will be a lemmings-style game, but with 3d projection, where the virtual camera follows the flock of lemmings from a 3rd person perspective. Players tilt the tablet to control the movements of the lemmings, and tap the screen to interact with objects and obstacles - such as a stream of water, which would then trigger a game action to place a ladder over it. The aim of the game is to survive as long as possible to maximise your score.

###Hardware Inputs
* Accelerometer for lemming control, tapping the screen to interact with obstacles.

###Visualisation
* The game will follow a flock of lemmings from a 3rd person perspective through a series of valleys, cliffs, mountains and obstacles. Landscapes will be generated by a series of predefined height maps. Water should use phong shading to show highlights on the water, while most of the landscape will use gouraud shading (for speed). As making the landscape very dark would make the game too difficult to play, there will always be a heavy amount of ambient light present, however a weak artificial light source will be implemented to give more depth to the visuals of the game.
###Game idea
Our project idea is to develop a game similar to the classic Lemmings, adapted for 3D and tablet accelerometer control.

###Features
####Camera Tracking
* The lemmings will be running along a 2D track that is followed by the 3rd person perspective camera
####Gyroscope
* The tablet gyroscope will control the camera and influence the lemmings, allowing the player to control their movement to some extent. Gyroscope input is used to influence a point of interest for the lemmings to flock toward.
####Touch events
* Certain obstacles may present themselves along the track that will require user interaction to resolve - for example, a drawbridge the player needs to tap to let the lemmings cross
####“Impending doom”
* Lemmings will be chased by some kind of object or force (eg rolling boulder, lava). This will require the player to maintain a certain constant speed forward lest the lemmings be consumed whatever is chasing them
####Artificial Intelligence
* Lemmings will exhibit flocking behaviour, such that the player controlled flock can be manouvered around obstacles and dangers towards and end goal-zone. The flock can be hunted by predators or be taken across dangerous/risky terrain in search of other lemmings to join the flock. Flock members that stray too far from the flock by becoming stuck on obstacles, falling down steep terrain, getting crushed, eaten or otherwise are lost from the flock. Player score is based on the time taken to reach the end goal zone modified by the size of collected flock at the end zone.
####Physics
* The game will rely heavily on a physics/force engine to allow the flock to traverse terrain, physics based puzzles (see-saw over dangerous terrain) and for controlling aspects of the traversable environment (e.g. mud patches cause the flock to travel slower and increase the risk of predators catching up to them).
####Global Scores
* Scores for each play are jointly proportional to the amount of time a player has lasted in the game, and the percentage of lemmings the player has retained after each level section. Scores are then synchronised across devices through the use of a simple webserver service or using Microsoft Azure.
####Pool-generated Levels
* Levels are generated from a pool of predefined tiles which progressively get more difficult over time as harder tiles are added to the pool. Each tile has a list of other tiles which can ‘continue’ the game, so when Tile A is first stepped on by the lemmings, Tile B is randomly selected from the list of continuing tiles from Tile A.

###Milestones
####Basic
* Implement free looking camera
* Physics system implementation (partially working already)
* Flocking behaviour (3 basic boid flock qualities)
* Render simple primitives (cubes, spheres, etc) for testing interoperability of all components
####Milestone 1
* Level design
* Basic XAML interface to start game, show about page, settings
####Milestone 2
* Level tiling from pool of level components
* Polish XAML interface with game styled assets (background, music, etc)
* In-game audio assets (background music, atmosphere, effects)
####Stretch goal 1
* “How to play” with interactivity, narrative, screenshots, etc
####Stretch goal 2
* Azure cloud storage of extra levels to add to the level pool
* Cloud storage of global high score list
